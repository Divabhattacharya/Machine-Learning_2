🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis 🌟 Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project! 🚀 This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze and predict the sentiment of tweets from Twitter. Whether it's positive, negative, or neutral, the goal is to help businesses, organizations, and individuals better understand public opinion in real-time! 📊💬

Why Twitter Sentiment Analysis? 🤔 In the world of social media, Twitter is one of the most powerful platforms for real-time discussions. By analyzing the sentiment of tweets, we can gain insights into:

Public opinion on various topics 🗣️ Reactions to current events 🌍 Sentiment towards brands, products, and services 🏷️ This project aims to automate the process of sentiment classification, helping businesses make data-driven decisions faster! 💡

🔧 Technologies & Tools Used Python: The primary programming language for the project. NLP (Natural Language Processing): Using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and TextBlob for text analysis. Machine Learning Models: Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Tweepy: For extracting live tweets from Twitter using their API. Pandas: For data manipulation and handling structured data. Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and insights. 🌍 Project Workflow Data Collection: Fetch real-time tweets using the Twitter API 🐦 Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the tweet text (removing stopwords, URLs, hashtags, etc.) ✂️ Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of each tweet (Positive, Negative, Neutral) 😄😞😐 Model Training: Train a machine learning model to classify tweet sentiment based on labeled data 📈 Results & Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score 📊 Visualization: Visualize sentiment distribution and insights via plots 📉 🚀 Getting Started To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/Divabhattacharya/Machine-Learning_2.git cd Machine-Learning_2 Install required dependencies: bash Copy Edit pip install -r requirements.txt Get your Twitter API keys by creating a developer account on Twitter and add them to your environment variables 🔑 Run the script to start analyzing Twitter sentiment: bash Copy Edit python sentiment_analysis.py 📊 Dataset The dataset consists of tweet text along with the sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). It can be sourced from:

Live Twitter API: Tweets fetched in real-time for dynamic analysis. CSV Files: A preprocessed dataset of tweets with sentiment labels for training the model. 🧠 Machine Learning Models This project uses multiple machine learning models to classify sentiment:

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective model for binary classification. Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier used for text classification tasks. Random Forest: A powerful ensemble method that works well for high-dimensional data. Neural Networks: For more advanced sentiment prediction. Each model is trained and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model will be used for final sentiment classification.

📈 Performance Evaluation We evaluate our models using:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions Precision: Correctly predicted positive instances out of total predicted positives Recall: Correctly predicted positive instances out of total actual positives F1-Score: A balanced measure of precision and recall 🌟 AI Innovations in Sentiment Analysis Real-time Sentiment Analysis: Analyze tweets in real-time to track ongoing trends. Multilingual Support: Handle sentiment analysis in multiple languages for global reach 🌍 Model Deployment: Deploy the best model into production for real-time sentiment predictions 💻 🤝 Contributing Feel free to contribute by:
